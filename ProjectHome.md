The goal of this project is to read log files created by the original Call of Duty game and generate a wide range of statistical web pages that describe the performance of each player.

The focus will be on creating a modern and polished user experience that provides interesting and entertaining information to players of the game. It will support a real-time mode for use during LAN party events, as well as a comprehensive static mode for after an event has ended. It will also include a custom game mod that will make it possible to extract additional statistics not available in the standard game. There is no interest at this time in supporting other games.
